    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>3 to 4 cups of all-purpose flour(if possible try and find flour with the ingredients "Whole wheat" and only "Whole Wheat") <a href="https://www.aubut.ca/en/products/details/organic-whole-wheat-bread-flour-5320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My choice of flour</a></li>
        <li>2 Tbsp of olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of Oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of Sumac</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of Tumeric</li>
        <li>1 pack of pizza yeast or equivalent</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup of warm water</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Incase you wondering "where the sugar?" This recipe does not require it. Some chefs would recommend sugar for the yeast, but I've noticed
        that what yeast requires is light and/or heat. Feel free to try this at home when creating the dough and put it in the sunlight to watch it grow.

    <h2>Steps on how to make the dough</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Step 1: Mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl</li>
        <li>Step 2: Add the water and oil to the bowl.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Meed the dough thoroughly by hand or by using a machine, until the dough until it retakes its' form. It should act a bit like playdough</li>
        <li>Step 3.5: While mixing the dough you might need to add water and/or flour. Do so in increments of 1 Tbsp. Mix between each addition.</li>
        <li>Step 4: Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or reusable cover. Then place it under a light or (if possible) the light. The yeast grows better in light.</li>
    </ul>
