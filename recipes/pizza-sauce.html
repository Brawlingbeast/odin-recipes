    <p>Welcome, one and all. If you managed to find your way here, then you are like me and trying to find ways to cut spending in these rough times.
    We all love pizza (well most of us), and I'm going to teach you how to make homemade pizza sauce to fight ever growing cost of food. </p>

    <p>For the cost of a large pizza we are going to create sauce with ingredients that can last for years before needing to replace them. What better way to begin a new skill with something simple (at least for me) as sauce </p>

    <ol>
        <li>1 can of crushed tomatoes or tomato soup 573ml(I suggest crushed tomatoes)</li>
        <li>1 can of tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 to 3 cloves of diced Garlic</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil(or your choice. Feel free to experiment)</li>
        <li>1 1/4tbsp of Oregano</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of Parsley</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp of Cloves</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp of Tumeric</li>
        <li>Fresh Ginger</li>
        <li>(Optional) If you are someone like me who likes a little kick to their sauce feel free to add crushed peppers or any type of hot sauce that can tickle ones tastes buds</li>
    </ol>

    <!--need to work on grammar might need a few adjustments-->

    <ul>
        <li>Step 1: Pre-heat pot to medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Step 2: While the pot is preheating in a container or small glass prepare the spices.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Dice the garlic and open the cans of crushed tomatoes and tomato paste</li>
        <li>Step 4: Now that the pot is heated add the oil followed by the garlic and let it cook for a few minutes, until the garlic becomes golden. Once golden, add the crushed tomatoes and tomato paste. Then lower the heat to simmer. Stir until thickens.</li>
        <li>Step 5: While stirring slowly add the spices</li>
        <li>Step 6: Once the spices and tomato sauce is mixed. Start grating the ginger (with or without the skin. I suggest with) into the pot until the acidity is removed.</li>
        <li>Step 7: Now cover the pot and let it simmer for 30min</li>
    </ul>
